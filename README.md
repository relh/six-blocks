# CitySim

**30 days. Six blocks. One neighborhood to keep alive.**

CitySim is a Coworld benchmark for AI agents. You are the manager of a fictional,
NYC-inspired six-block neighborhood of about 100 residents. You have thirty simulated
days, a $500,000 budget, and up to three interventions per day. Residents commute, pay
rent, get sick, open and lose businesses, and react to everything you do — and to the
seeded events (heat waves, floods, rent spikes, festivals) that hit the neighborhood
while you manage it.

The question the benchmark asks: **given limited money, incomplete information,
heterogeneous residents, and changing city conditions, can an AI make decisions that
create a thriving neighborhood?**

## How an episode works

Each simulated day:

1. The game sends you a **dashboard**: budget, mood, rents, mobility, cleanliness,
   business health, active events, alerts, and per-block summaries.
2. You may **inspect** anything (`city`, `block`, `resident`, `business`, `transit`,
   `housing`) — inspections are free and unlimited.
3. You may fund up to **three interventions** (each costs money now, and most add
   daily upkeep).
4. You send `end_day`. The simulation advances: residents run their routines,
   businesses respond, housing and events resolve, and a replay frame is recorded.

After day 30 the episode ends and a multidimensional score (0–100) is computed.

## Action space

Twelve interventions, all block-targeted:

`increase_trash_pickup`, `add_bus_service`, `add_bike_capacity`, `repair_playground`,
`build_small_park`, `open_cooling_center`, `fund_small_business`, `give_rent_relief`,
`add_street_lighting`, `fund_community_event`, `improve_clinic_capacity`,
`pedestrianize_street`.

Costs, upkeep, and plain-language effects are sent in the welcome message; see
[docs/player_protocol.md](docs/player_protocol.md).

## Scoring

The score blends resident welfare, affordability, mobility, health, cleanliness,
economic health, equity/displacement, fiscal sustainability, and resilience — final
state plus trajectory, normalized to 0–100. Philosophy in [docs/scoring.md](docs/scoring.md).

The simulation is **deterministic by seed**: same seed + same actions ⇒ identical
trajectory, score, and replay.

## Repository layout

- `citysim/simulation/` — deterministic simulation core (pure Python, no I/O)
- `citysim/game/` — Coworld game container (FastAPI + WebSockets + p5.js clients)
- `citysim/player/` — baseline scripted player container
- `citysim/policies/` — scripted strategies incl. `balanced_baseline`
- `tools/benchmark.py` — strategy comparison over many seeds
- `tools/generate_assets.mjs` — deterministic procedural asset generation

## Running locally

```bash
# tests (25 deterministic tests)
uv venv .venv -p 3.12 && uv pip install -p .venv -e '.[dev]'
.venv/bin/pytest

# regenerate procedural assets
npm run generate-assets

# headless local episode: server + baseline player
COGAME_CONFIG_URI=file:///tmp/sb/config.json \
COGAME_RESULTS_URI=file:///tmp/sb/results.json \
COGAME_SAVE_REPLAY_URI=file:///tmp/sb/replay.json \
python -m citysim.game.server &
COWORLD_PLAYER_WS_URL='ws://localhost:8080/player?slot=0&token=<token>' \

```

Browser play: open `http://localhost:8080/client/player?slot=0&token=<token>`
(spectator: `/client/global`, replay: `/client/replay`). Press `d` in the world view
for the visual debug overlay.

## Coworld build / certify / upload

```bash
uv run coworld build          # builds the image from compose.yaml, hydrates the manifest
uv run coworld certify coworld_manifest.json
uv run coworld upload-coworld coworld_manifest.json
uv run coworld run-episode <manifest-or-id>
```

## Writing your own player

Connect a WebSocket to `COWORLD_PLAYER_WS_URL`, read the `welcome` and daily
`dashboard` messages, send `inspect` / `action` / `end_day` JSON messages. Full
protocol with examples: [docs/player_protocol.md](docs/player_protocol.md). The
baseline in `citysim/player/player.py` is a complete working example.

## Training

`python -m citysim.training_bridge` runs the deterministic game core through the shared Coworld JSONL decision
protocol. The bridge trains the single manager seat from the daily dashboard. Its numeric codec has 67 city and block
values and 73 fixed action slots: the 12 interventions on six blocks plus `end_day`. Illegal interventions are masked
using the game's own cost and precondition checks. The shipped `balanced_baseline` supplies teacher actions, and
terminal utility maps the game's 0–100 score to [-1, 1].

Pass this command to Metta's `recipes.external.coworld_metta_rl` or `recipes.external.coworld` with `players=1` and a
finite timestep limit. Metta post-training can collect full 30-day teacher trajectories from the same bridge. The
codec uses the dashboard; free `inspect` calls remain available in the hosted player protocol and are not modeled by
this numeric policy.
